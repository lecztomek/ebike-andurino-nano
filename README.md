# Arduino Pedal Assist System (PAS) Controller

This project is a custom **Pedal Assist System (PAS) controller** for an electric bike, based on an **Arduino-compatible microcontroller** and **I2C LCD display**. It reads pedal movement using a PAS sensor, allows level-based assist adjustment, and outputs a PWM signal to simulate a throttle signal (e.g., to an e-bike controller).

The controller also includes **walk-assist mode**, **configuration menu**, and **EEPROM storage** for user settings.

## üîß Features

- Adjustable **assist levels** (0 to N).  
- Configurable **min RPM** to activate assist.  
- Smooth **ramp-up logic** for assist power.  
- **Walk assist mode** with delay and ramp.  
- Adjustable **PWM output voltage range** (min/max voltage simulation).  
- EEPROM storage for all settings.  
- **LCD interface with buttons** for configuration.

## üß™ How It Works

- The PAS sensor generates pulses when you pedal. The system samples these pulses at regular intervals to estimate **RPM**.
- If RPM is above a configured **minimum RPM**, the assist becomes active and **ramps up** to a power level based on the selected assist level.
- The assist level can be **increased or decreased** using the **Up** and **Down** buttons. A higher level results in more power delivered to the motor (stronger assist).
- If **Walk Assist** is triggered (pedal is idle, level = 0, walk button pressed), assist power ramps to a fixed walk value.
- A **PWM signal** is generated on pin D9. The duty cycle maps to a voltage range (e.g., 1V‚Äì4.2V), simulating throttle output to the controller.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Setting the correct number of magnets in the PAS sensor** is crucial ‚Äî wrong value will cause inaccurate RPM detection and poor assist behavior.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Menu

Enter settings by **holding the SET button for ~1.5s**.

You can configure the following options using the **Up/Down buttons**, and go to the next setting using the **Set button**:

1. Number of PAS magnets  
2. Walk assist power (%)  
3. Walk assist delay (ms)  
4. Minimum RPM for assist activation  
5. Ramp time for assist (ms)  
6. Number of assist levels  
7. RPM sampling interval (ms)  
8. **PWM minimum voltage**  
9. **PWM maximum voltage**  

All settings are saved automatically to **EEPROM** when exiting the settings menu.

## üîª RC Low-Pass Filter (Required)

Most e-bike controllers expect a **smooth analog voltage**, not a PWM signal. A **low-pass RC filter** is required to convert the PWM output into a stable voltage that mimics the throttle.

### üìè How to Check Throttle Voltage Range

To correctly simulate a throttle signal, you must match the **PWM voltage range** to what your e-bike controller expects (e.g., 1.0V to 4.2V). To find this range:

1. Disconnect the throttle from the controller.
2. Use a multimeter (in DC mode) to measure voltage:
   - **Ground** (black probe) ‚Üí GND wire
   - **Positive** (red probe) ‚Üí Signal wire from throttle
3. Turn throttle to **minimum** ‚Üí note voltage (e.g., 1.0V)
4. Turn throttle to **maximum** ‚Üí note voltage (e.g., 4.2V)
5. Enter these values in the PAS controller settings menu as **PWM Min/Max Voltage**

This ensures the e-bike controller interprets the PWM output correctly.

**RC Filter Schematic:**

This filter consists of:
- Resistor (R) in series with PWM output  
- Capacitor (C) to ground from the output side  
Together they form a **first-order low-pass filter**.

### ‚úÖ Recommended Starting Values

```
Resistor:     R = 1 kŒ©  
Capacitor:    C = 1 ¬µF
```

This gives a cutoff frequency of about 159 Hz, which works well for Arduino PWM (490 Hz).

### üîß Filter Formula:

```
f_c = 1 / (2œÄRC)
```

Example:
```
f_c = 1 / (2 √ó œÄ √ó 1000 √ó 0.000001) ‚âà 159 Hz
```

### üí° Alternate values:

| R (Œ©) | C (¬µF) | Cutoff (Hz) | Notes                    |
|-------|--------|--------------|---------------------------|
| 1k    | 1.0    | ~159 Hz      | Good balance (default)    |
| 1k    | 2.2    | ~72 Hz       | Smoother, but slower      |
| 1k    | 0.47   | ~338 Hz      | Faster, more ripple       |
