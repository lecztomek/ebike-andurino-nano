# Arduino Pedal Assist System (PAS) Controller

This project is a custom **Pedal Assist System (PAS) controller** for an electric bike, based on an **Arduino-compatible microcontroller** and **I2C LCD display**. It reads pedal movement using a PAS sensor, allows level-based assist adjustment, and outputs a PWM signal to simulate a throttle signal (e.g., to an e-bike controller).

The controller also includes **walk-assist mode**, **configuration menu**, and **EEPROM storage** for user settings.

## üîß Features

- Adjustable **assist levels** (0 to N).
- Configurable **min RPM** to activate assist.
- Smooth **ramp-up logic** for assist power.
- **Walk assist mode** with delay and ramp.
- Adjustable **PWM output voltage range** (min/max voltage simulation).
- EEPROM storage for all settings.
- **LCD interface with buttons** for configuration.

## üß∞ Hardware Requirements

- **Arduino Uno / Nano** or compatible board
- **I2C 16x2 LCD display** (e.g. based on PCF8574)
- **PAS sensor** (pedal cadence sensor)
- 5x push-buttons:
  - Assist Up
  - Assist Down
  - Walk Assist
  - PAS signal input (connected to PAS sensor output)
  - Set button (long press to enter settings)
- Optional: pull-up resistors (if not using `INPUT_PULLUP`)
- **PWM Output** (D9 by default) connected to the **e-bike controller‚Äôs throttle input**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Menu

Enter settings by **holding the SET button for ~1.5s**.

You can configure the following options using the **Up/Down buttons**, and go to the next setting using the **Set button**:

1. Number of PAS magnets
2. Walk assist power (%)
3. Walk assist delay (ms)
4. Minimum RPM for assist activation
5. Ramp time for assist (ms)
6. Number of assist levels
7. RPM sampling interval (ms)
8. **PWM minimum voltage**
9. **PWM maximum voltage**

All settings are saved automatically to **EEPROM** when exiting the settings menu.

## üß™ How It Works

- The PAS sensor generates pulses when you pedal. The system samples these pulses at regular intervals to estimate **RPM**.
- If RPM is above a configured **minimum RPM**, the assist becomes active and **ramps up** to a power level based on the selected assist level.
- If **Walk Assist** is triggered (pedal is idle, level = 0, walk button pressed), assist power ramps to a fixed walk value.
- A **PWM signal** is generated on pin D9. The duty cycle maps to a voltage range (e.g., 1V‚Äì4.2V), simulating throttle output.
